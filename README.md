## Timezone Web App

This repository includes a simple static web app that displays the current time in multiple time zones. The code is located in the `timezone-web-app` folder.

To use the app, open `timezone-web-app/index.html` in any modern web browser. The page will automatically update the time for each listed zone every second.
