## Timezone Web App

This repository includes a simple static web app that displays the current time
in multiple time zones. The code is located in the `timezone-web-app` folder.
To use the app, open `timezone-web-app/index.html` in any modern web browser. The
page will automatically update the time for each listed zone every second.

## Peruvian Cooking Websites

The `peruvian-cooking-websites` folder contains a small web page that lists a
few popular sites for exploring Peruvian cuisine. Open
`peruvian-cooking-websites/index.html` in your browser to see the links.

## Cybersecurity News App

The `cybersecurity-news-app` directory contains a very small web application that serves an HTML page with placeholder text for cybersecurity news. It uses Node's built-in `http` module so it works offline. Run it with `npm start` inside that folder and visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## ENTILABS Landing Page

The `entilabs-web-app` folder contains a basic React frontâ€‘end that introduces
ENTILABS, a company focused on application development, automation of critical
processes and AI agents. Open `entilabs-web-app/index.html` in your browser to
view the announcement and contact information.
